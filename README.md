# Motivation
Physical library collections are valuable and long-standing resources for knowledge and learning. However, managing and finding books or other volumes on a large collection of bookshelves often leads to tedious manual work, especially for large collections where books or others might be missing or misplaced. Recently, deep neural-based models have been successful in detecting and recognizing text in images taken from natural scenes. Based on this, we investigate deep learning for facilitating book management. It is specifically designed for our text recognition model using rich supervision to accelerate training and achieve the same using our own datasets. The proposed system has the potential to greatly reduce the amount of manual labor required for managing book inventories.

# Introduction
The method that is used here is the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) which simply means the conversion of handwritten text images electrically into a format that can be editable and searchable. OCR is implemented in various fields like Banking, Healthcare, and other industrial applications. It can be done in many methods. Some of the methods to implement this OCR is using ANN (Artificial Neural Networks), CNN, KNN clustering and so on. In our case, we make use of ANN (Artificial Neural Network) i.e. BPA (Back Propagation Algorithm). The main objective of the proposed project is to implement OCR for smart library simulation.
The specific observations are as follows:
•	To scan the given hand-written documents.
•	To apply OCR on the hand-written image.
•	Use BPA and get the desired list of books in text form.
